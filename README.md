# Udemy Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes Udemy course data. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of Udemy courses, such as pricing, popularity, and content distribution.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides a detailed examination of Udemy course data, utilizing Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It employs libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore and visualize trends.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
  - Reads the Udemy dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
  - Handles missing or inconsistent data entries to ensure accuracy.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Descriptive statistics to summarize key metrics.
  - Visualizations to uncover patterns in course prices, ratings, and categories.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots for deeper insights.
  - Heatmaps to analyze correlations between variables.

- **Insights and Observations:**
  - Key takeaways from the data, such as popular course categories, average pricing trends, and factors influencing ratings.
